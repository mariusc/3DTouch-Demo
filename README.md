# 3DTouch Demo 


Simple project to demonstrate how to implement some of the 3D Touch capabilities in an iOS project: Peek, Pop, home screen quick actions and peek preview actions.
The project was used as a demo in an internal presentation I gave at [Nodes](http://www.nodes.dk) on 3D Touch.

Part of the project uses code from [SwiftEnumPatternTableView](https://github.com/NatashaTheRobot/SwiftEnumPatternTableView).
